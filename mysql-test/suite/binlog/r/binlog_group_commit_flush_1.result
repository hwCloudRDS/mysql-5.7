# 1. S1 leader did enter GC-S0 to flush engine log.
# 2. S0 leader did NOT enter GC-S0 and became a follower when entering S1.
# 3. S1 leader should flush engine log (for S0 leader).
# 4. Crash after flushing engine log by S1 leader, and after recovery
#    we should not see the inserted value from either transactions
#    since binlog has not been flushed/sync'ed yet.
